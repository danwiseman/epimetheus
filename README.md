Epimetheus is a Slack Bot that integrates with Local LLMs (currently Ollama), to keep
AI local and in house. Using Slack Emojis, that are defined in the configuration page,
your Slack users can chose the appropriate model. For example, use :avocado: and have it
call a code based model.

The default model can be chosen in the configuration page.

## Why Another Slack Bot?

The point of this Slack Bot is to keep the AI interaction within the organization and
not use your user's chats to train some one else's models.

Epimetheus will also soon incorporate AI tools and RAGs to give the user's a very
useful chat bot that is fully customized for their use.

## Plans

The planned features are:

- RAG support. Local private documents supported in a RAG
- Image generation. Using Comfy UI to generate images
- Custom prompts per model based on the emojis (under dev now)
